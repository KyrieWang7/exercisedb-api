It's ideal for individuals at an intermediate fitness level who want to improve their upper body strength and muscle definition. By incorporating this exercise into their routine, users can enhance their overall appearance, boost functional strength, and improve performance in sports and activities requiring strong chest muscles.",
  "instructions": [
    "Sit on the pec deck machine with your back firmly against the pad and place your forearms on the padded levers, ensuring elbows and shoulders are aligned.",
    "Push the levers together slowly, focusing on squeezing your chest muscles, until your hands meet in front of your chest.",
    "Hold this position for a second to maximize contraction of the chest muscles.",
    "Slowly return to the starting position, allowing your chest to stretch, and repeat for the desired reps."
  ],
  "exerciseTips": [
    "Controlled Movements: Avoid using momentum to lift heavier weights. Focus on slow, controlled reps to properly target the pectorals.",
    "Full Range of Motion: Bring handles together until they touch, then return until chest is fully stretched. Avoid stopping early or overextending.",
    "Proper Breathing: Exhale as you bring the handles together and inhale as you return."
  ],
